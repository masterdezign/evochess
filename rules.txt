 The EvoChess Game
 =================

 == EvoChess rules

 0. === Chess-Based Rules
    - In general, the pieces move and the Pawns are promoted similarly to chess.
    - During the promotion, only the pieces of the same color are available.
    - The first long Pawn move is allowed and is counted as a single move.
    - En passant is defined as in chess.
    - Checks, mates, and stalemates are defined by the standard chess rules.

 1. === EvoChess Starting Position
    The game starts only with 8 Pawns and a King of each color
    on their standard chess positions.

 2. === The First Evolutionary Addendum aka "To Minor Piece Promotion"
    In addition to chess rules, Pawns may be promoted to minor pieces
    under the following conditions. After every N = 3 Pawn moves,
    the player gains the right to promote to a minor piece (a Knight or a Bishop)
    the last Pawn that moved.

 3. === The Second Evolutionary Addendum aka "To Rook Promotion"
    After every K = 2 (non-Pawn) opponent piece captures, ANY player's
    minor piece on the board can be promoted to a rook (even if it wasn't the
    last piece to move).

 4. === Clarifications
    - The promotion rights, both for Pawns and minor pieces, are accumulated
      indefinitely.

      ==== Consider the white Pawns promotion example

           | Move # | Comment
      ======================================================================
      e4   | 1      | A Pawn moves.
      ..   |        |
      d4   | 3      | Another Pawn moves.
      ..   |        |
      d5   | 5      | The same Pawn moves again, and the "To Minor Piece Promotion"
           |        | right is obtained. No promotion is obligatory.
      ..   |        |
      d6   | 7      | A Pawn moves without promotion.
           |        | The player's "To Minor Piece Promotion" right from the
           |        | previous moves is preserved.
      ..   |        |
      b4=N | 9      | A Pawn moves and is promoted to a minor piece.
      ..   |        |
      Nd5  | 11     | The minor piece moves. No evolution.
      ..   |        |
      a4=B | 13     | The 6th Pawn move counts towards regaining the
           |        | "To Minor Piece Promotion" right. The Pawn gets promoted.

      Remark: The next N - 1 = 2 Pawn moves, Pawns have no evochess promotion
              rights unless the 8th rank was reached.

      Remark: The 8th rank Pawn promotion is obligatory as in standard chess
              and is also counted towards the Pawn moves.

    - Capturing moves by Pawns are counted towards both "To Minor Piece Promotion"
      and "To Rook Promotion".

    - A promotion is available only in the end of the player's move.

    - Only one piece at a time can be promoted even if several conditions are
      met and/or rights accumulated (e.g. capture + Pawn move).

    - If the 8th rank is reached by a Pawn, the Pawn promotion is obligatory.
      No other promotions are possible at that move.

    - Castling is not defined.
